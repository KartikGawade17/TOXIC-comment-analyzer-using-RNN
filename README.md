- TOXIC COMMENT ANALYZER is the project which finds the toxicity of the comment

- In this project I have taken 1,60,000 comments, where the comments are divided in various parts and have various types of toxicity, like severe_toxic,
threat, insult, etc.

- THE ACCURACY the model has created is 98%

- The neural network that i have used are RNN and LSTM(BIDIRECTIONAL)
